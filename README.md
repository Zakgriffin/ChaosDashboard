# ChaosDashboard

This is a heavily modified branch of FRC Dashboard, a project created to allow teams in FIRST Robotics to use a web based dashboard.

ChaosDashboard is developed specifically for 2458 Team Chaos
and uses:

TypeScript - For static typing while still having the power of JS

React - For component based UI designing

Electron - For transforming the web app into a standalone app

Three - For 3D rendering, a simplified WebGL abstraction

Webpack - For organizing entry points and transpiling
